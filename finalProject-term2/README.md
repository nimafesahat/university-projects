# Final Project, term 2 (Advance programming) | برنامه سازی پیشرفته
In this project I have a tourist assistant that shows some location with its own attractions.
you can see all attractions and see reviews for all attractions from some users.
also you can add a new review with a new user for a selected attraction with a new name and email.

## insert.cpp
I inserted some data for testing and showing that how the program is working with this file.
to make binary files and insert data, run this file just once.
!! i run this file already!!

## some description
I wrote each class in a unique file with the same file name and class for clear code.
and also i wrote main code in main.cpp file.
